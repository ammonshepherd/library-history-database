<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#800000"><strong>The Project</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#000000">This project has been underway ever
since I started teaching Library History at University College London in 1991. The aim (if
not the execution) has been to compile in database format a finding aid for the history of
libraries in the British Isles to 1850, a convenient terminus as it coincides with the
Public Libraries Act. Had I suspected that the volume of data would grow to such a vast
size, I might well have abandoned the project. The evidence in these files now occupies
30,000 records in six databases. What is available here represents about half of what will
eventually be published when I have had the time to complete and edit the remaining files.
I owe a great debt of gratitude to the numerous friends and colleagues who have
unselfishly put at my disposal their expertise and data. Because of their generosity I
therefore ask all who make use of the information I have provided to treat these files
with respect and courtesy and to acknowledge use of them in scholarly publishing.</font></p>

<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#000000">The preparation of the raw information
for presentation on the Web has been a colossal exercise, and I do not pretend that this
first version satisfies me entirely. Interrogating a database is relatively
straightforward: devising lists that may prove useful in HTML format is not quite so
straightforward. Nevertheless, given the power and flexibility of today's browsers it
should be possible to discover almost any type of meaningful information without
difficulty. I have eschewed a flashy approach, and concentrated on functionality and
legibility. Even so, I am sure that novel approaches will emerge when all the files have
been edited and prepared for public view.</font></p>

<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#000000">Since the various databases I use are
intended primarily as finding aids, notes tend to be terse and informal. Abbreviations
(mostly self explanatory) are used throughout. Abbreviations used for scholarly books can
be verified in the </font><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#0000FF">Sources</font><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#000000"> file. The volume of data included in the
various listings amounts to over 10 </font><font face="AGaramond" color="#000000" size="2">MB</font><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#000000">: when completed this is expected to rise to
over 20 </font><font face="AGaramond" color="#000000" size="2">MB</font><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#000000">. Put another way: if printed out on A4 it
represents over 10,000 pages. As far as well-known libraries are concerned it is assumed
that the literature is familiar and is not repeated here: most users will be familiar with
the Library Association's <em>A Directory of Rare Book and Special Collections in the
United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland</em> (London, 1985; revised edition, 1997.)
Files not yet in a fit state to publish include </font><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#0000FF">Private Libraries</font><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#000000">, </font><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#0000FF">Town &amp; Country Houses</font><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#000000">, and </font><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#0000FF">Population Statistics</font><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#000000">. I hope that these will be available later this year.</font></p>

<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#000000">One obvious reason for putting these
files on the Web is to improve them, and I hope that those who use them will advise me of
mistakes and omissions, and the inevitable keying errors. Miscodings still lurk in the
databases, but as anyone who has experience with complex data structures knows, keeping a
database tidy is an endless (and nearly hopeless) task. The Web was designed to facilitate
cooperative scholarship -even if it is now used mostly for promotional purposes - and I
hope that those who find these files useful will share their particular expertise.</font></p>

<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#000000">There are still numerous directories
and sources which I have not had access to in London, particularly for Wales, Scotland and
Ireland. I hope to have time this year to remedy their omission from the files contained
here.</font></p>

<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#000000">My particular thanks for help in
compiling the data to: Keith Manley, John Crawford, Peter Reid, Barry McKay, Peter Isaac,
Michael Perkin, Richard Goulden, Elisabeth Leedham-Green, Peter Hoare, and the numerous
correspondents who have drawn my attention to libraries I might well have missed. I am, of
course, particularly grateful to the Centre for English Studies at London University for
agreeing to mount these files on the School of Advanced Study web server, and to John
Lazenbatt for patiently making sure that everything works as it should.</font></p>

<p><font face="AGaramond" size="3" color="#FF0000">There are <strong>no </strong>pictures!
They seemed quite unnecessary in what is intended as a research resource.</font></p>
